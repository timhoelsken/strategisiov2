 004 |  Evaluate positioning methods

===================================
= UseCase "Initially Positioning" =
===================================
checkGround(M, x, y) => checks if Movable is allowed to be on the field's ground
checkIfIsEmpty(x, y) => checks if any Movable is on a field
=> one method that checks if both conditions are true:
	checkPositioningPossibility(M, x, y)

position(M, x, y)    => sets Movable on field
=> check is done before, positioning possible in every case

a complete combinin method is not needed, because check is before set


================================
= UseCase "Moving During Game" =
================================
ONLY FOR FIGURES!!
checkGround(F, x, y) => checks if Movable is allowed to be on the field's ground
=> same as checkGround(M, x, y)
checkIfIsEmptyOrEnemy(F, x, y) => checks if any Movable of the enemy is on the field or if it's empty
=> can use checkIfIsEmpty(x, y)
   and checkIfIsVsMovable(M, x, y)

=> one method that checks if both conditions are true:
	checkMovingPossibility(F, x, y)

move(F, x, y)    => moves Movable on field and evaluates consequences:
	checkIfIsEnemy(F, x, y) => checks if any Movable of the enemy is on the field
==> just position(), beTrappedOrBombedOrSomething() or fight()
