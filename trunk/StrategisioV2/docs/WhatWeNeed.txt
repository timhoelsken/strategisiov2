 004 |  Evaluate positioning methods

===================================
= UseCase "Initially Positioning" =
===================================
checkGround(M, x, y) => checks if Movable is allowed to be on field
checkIfIsEmpty(x, y) => checks if any Movable is on a field
=> one method that checks if both conditions are true:
	checkIfIsSettable(M, x, y)

position(M, x, y)    => sets Movable on field
=> check is done before, positioning possible in every case

a complete combinin method is not needed, because check is before set
